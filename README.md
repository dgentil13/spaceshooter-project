    <h1> ASTRO BLASTER - THE GAME </h1>
  
    <p>
    Astro Blaster is a space shooter game created as a project for Ironhack module 1. 
    It runs enterely in JavaScript and HTML Canvas(using classes and objects).
    This is my first game, I was able to expand my knowledge beyond my expectations and achieved a result that I'm very proud of.

    </p>
    <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
    <p>
      Hit asteroids and enemy ships (enemy ships take two hits to die) to gain score points,
      you have 3 lives - as displayed in the top right corner.
      If you get hit, you have 2 seconds of invincibility to give you time to reposition, but you also loose the ability to shoot.
      The little pink boxes are power ups! They make you shoot larger bullets, which makes hitting enemies easier.
