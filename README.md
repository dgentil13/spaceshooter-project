<p>
Astro Blaster is a space shooter game created as a project for Ironhack module 1. <br>
It runs enterely in JavaScript and HTML Canvas(using classes and objects).<br>
This is my first game, I was able to expand my knowledge beyond my expectations and achieved a result that I'm very proud of.

<h2> CONTROLS: </h2>
<p>
  Use arrow keys do move: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.<br>
  Use space bar to shoot!
</p>
<h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
<p>
  Hit asteroids and enemy ships (enemy ships take two hits to die) to gain score points,
  you have 3 lives - as displayed in the top right corner.<br>
  You can only have 5 bullets at once in the screen, so use them wisely. <br>
  If you get hit, you have 2 seconds of invincibility to give you time to reposition, but you also loose the ability to shoot.<br>
  The little pink boxes are power ups! They make you shoot larger bullets, which makes hitting enemies easier. <br>
  The speed of the game is increased accordingly to your score (50-100-200 points).
